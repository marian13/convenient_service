# Defines `ds` helper in order to have a quick way to find differences between strings like `git diff`.
#
# @param first_string [String]
# @param second_string [String]

#
# @note `ds' is a dev-only helper.
# @note `ds` is a short for `diff_strings`.

# @example
#   first_string = <<~TEXT
#     Step of `AnonymousClass(#14360)` is passed as constructor argument `kwargs[:baz]` to `AnonymousClass(#14360)`.

#     It is an antipattern. It neglects the idea of steps.
